### "Rails developers are a passionate bunch. Itâ€™s almost like a religion to them. Gartner says there are a million Ruby programmers today, but analyst Mark Driver reckons that by 2013 there will be four million. [Evans Data] found that Ruby use in North America alone has jumped 40% in the past year, with 14% of developers now using it at least part of the time." ###
